Scene Organization
====================

This tutorial series aims to illustrate intended Godot workflows, i.e. the
"best practices" of defining one's game API. Godot allows for a great 
amount of flexibility in how one designs a project's code and scene
structure. Each method will have its own advantages and disadvantages,
so outlining the best practices should help users feel less confused
as they further explore Godot's depth.

It will help users understand, among other things...

- what scenes and classes really are
- how to structure a scene effectively
- when to use scenes versus scripts
- when to use signals versus methods
- when and how to have scenes interact with each other
- when and how to avoid using nodes for everything
- how users can use names, groups, method checks, and duck-typing for
  implicit interfaces
